Notes

Just a few things I wanted to share with you for the BCI simulations

1) I realize that, as we start during the dry season (BCI),
plants might experience severe drought stress at the beginning of the simulation.
So in my runs at least it was needed to initialize the water content with
higher values (I use the middistance between the field capacity
and the porosity for now)

2) In my runs, the LAI (and AGB) was constantly decreasing from the initial
conditions and to avoid this I had to decrease the clumping factor of the
different PFTs I was using (down to 0.5) and also the turnover rates.

3) To help the PFTs, as suggested by Mike, I also had to provide the
tree cohorts some initial carbon storage (0.1 their living tissues)
but you have to change the code to do so.

Here is an example of minimal config file I currently use
